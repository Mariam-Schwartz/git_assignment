# Git Assignment - Mariam-Schwartz

a. What is an issue?
Issues are used to track todos, bugs, feature requests, and more. As issues are created, theyâ€™ll appear here in a searchable and filterable list.

b. What is a pull request?
A pull request is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another.

c. Describe the steps to open a pull request?
Find a project you want to contribute to
Fork it
Clone it to your local system
Make a new branch
Make your changes
Push it back to your repo
Click the Compare & pull request button
Click Create pull request to open a new pull request
If the reviewers ask for changes, repeat steps 5 and 6 to add more commits to your pull request.

d. Describe the steps to add a collaborator to a repository (share write permissions)
Ask for the username of the person you're inviting as a collaborator. If they don't have a username yet, they can sign up for GitHub. For more information, see "Creating an account on GitHub."
On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
Under your repository name, click Settings. If you cannot see the "Settings" tab, select the dropdown menu, then click Settings.
In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click Collaborators.
Click Add people.
In the search field, start typing the name of person you want to invite, then click a name in the list of matches.
Click Add NAME to REPOSITORY.
The user will receive an email inviting them to the repository. Once they accept your invitation, they will have collaborator access to your repository.
